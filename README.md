This project was created to review and practice my skills on Vanilla JS.

A lightweight, dependency-free vanilla JavaScript image gallery with TypeScript support.

## Goals: 
    - Create a simple image gallery which can be installed from NPM.
    - Use Typescript and Vanilla JS, no other dependencies.
    - Offer some customization as colors, but don't go deep: Keep it simple.
    - Focus on make the code readable, easy to understand and use modern JS.
    - Include a demo.
